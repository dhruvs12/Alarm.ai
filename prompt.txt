I want to create a React Native iOS app that helps users set and track daily goals with smart notifications. The app should have the following features:
1. Firebase Integration:
Authentication (email/password)
Firestore database for storing goals and notifications
Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
Core Screens:
Login/Register screen with email/password authentication
Dashboard showing goal completion statistics and active goals
Alarm setup screen for setting daily goals
Goal input screen that appears when alarm triggers
Smart Features:
Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to analyze goals and suggest optimal reminder times
Local notifications using PushNotificationIOS
Dark/Light theme support with context-based theme management
Offline support with AsyncStorage for data persistence
Technical Requirements:
Use React Navigation for screen management
Implement proper error handling and loading states
Use context for auth and theme management
Environment variable support for API keys
Firebase config setup
The app should follow the existing structure where:
Authentication logic is handled in AuthContext
Theme management is handled in ThemeContext
Notifications are managed through a dedicated service
Local storage operations are abstracted into a StorageService
The app uses a stack navigator for screen navigation
Please help me create this project in Xcode, providing the necessary code and configuration files, including proper folder structure and dependencies. The app should maintain state between sessions and handle offline/online synchronization with Firebase."
